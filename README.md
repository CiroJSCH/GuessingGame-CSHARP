# Guessing game using C#

This if my first project to learn C#. It's about a Guessing game with 3 difficulties. Based on the user choice, the random generated number will be in a more wide range.

The program will inform us if our choice is lower or higher.

When we guess the number, it shows us the total number of attempts and then asks us if we want to play again.
