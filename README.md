# Guessing game using C#

This is my first project to learn C#. This is a Guessing game with 3 difficulties. Depending on the user's choice, the randomly generated number will be in a wider range.

The program will inform us if our choice is lower or higher.

When we guess the number, it shows us the total number of attempts and then asks us if we want to play again.
